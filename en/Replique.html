            This line is taken from the 2013 film Rush, which chronicles the 1976 Formula 1 season, a season marked by the rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda. It was James Hunt who uttered this line.</p>

            <p class="texte_article">This line is very important, as it gives viewers of the film a vision of the way in which drivers approach racing and death, which is very different from that of a normal person. The two drivers had very different personalities: James Hunt had a more daring approach to racing, while Niki Lauda was more calculating and pragmatic. This shows that the drivers had the same passion but a different approach to racing, what didn't change between them was the competitive spirit, pushing the limits of your car and yourself to prove to others that you're the best. Cars were fast and powerful, but they didn't have the same safety features as today, and circuits were often narrow and lined with metal barriers. For drivers, racing was a way of living life to the full, allowing them to push their limits and experience an excitement and adrenalin that few other sports could offer.Even if it is becoming increasingly rare, this replica sums up part of the history of Formula 1, as death is unfortunately still part of this sport. Nearly 45 drivers have unfortunately lost their lives since the creation of the Formula 1 world championship in 1950, including 1 in the 21st century. </p>

            <p class="texte_article" >Fortunately, today's Formula 1 has become much safer, with increasingly secure infrastructures and stricter safety regulations, the advent of large gravel clearances to brake cars that run off the track, and the arrival of Tecpro to replace metal barriers. 
                To conclude, death is and will remain present in this sport because Formula 1 is a dangerous sport and there are certain factors that cannot be changed, such as the dangerous behaviour of certain drivers or a mechanical problem that can lead to an accident. The drivers know that they are risking their lives, but that is part of the passion of this sport.
